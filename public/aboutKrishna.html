<h1> Lord Krishna Story</h1>
<h2>Krishna and the Butter Thieves</h2>
In the peaceful village of Gokul, little Krishna was known for his love of butter. 
Every day, his mother, Yashoda, would churn fresh butter, but no matter how carefully 
she hid it, Krishna always found a way to get his hands on it.He would gather his 
friends, and together, they would sneak into the houses of the villagers, forming 
human pyramids to reach the pots of butter hung high from the ceiling. 
The villagers loved Krishna, but they were puzzled by how he managed to steal the butter 
without getting caught.

<h2>The Mischief is Discovered</h2>
One day, the villagers decided they had enough of Krishna’s mischief.
They went to Yashoda to complain, and she promised to keep a close eye on her son.
That afternoon, Yashoda was busy with her chores when she suddenly realized that Krishna was nowhere to be seen.
Suspecting that he was up to no good, she quietly followed him and his friends as 
they tiptoed into a neighbor’s house. Just as Krishna reached up to grab the pot of butter, Yashoda appeared, catching him in the act.

<h2>Yashoda’s Clever Plan</h2>
Instead of scolding Krishna, Yashoda decided to teach him a lesson. She gently tied him 
to a large, heavy wooden mortar and told him that he would not be allowed 
to play until he learned not to steal. Krishna, however, was not one to be easily defeated. 
He began to crawl, dragging the heavy mortar behind him. 
As he moved, the mortar got stuck between two large trees, and with a little tug from Krishna, the trees suddenly 
fell over with a loud crash! To everyone’s amazement, two shining spirits emerged from the 
fallen trees and bowed to Krishna before disappearing into the sky.

<h2>Krishna’s Lesson</h2>
Yashoda and the villagers were astonished by what they had seen. 
They realized that Krishna was no ordinary child but someone with divine powers. 
Yashoda untied Krishna and hugged him tightly, understanding that her son was special. 
From that day on, the villagers loved Krishna even more, and although he continued his playful mischief, 
they knew it was all part of the magic that made Krishna who he was. Krishna, too, 
learned to be a little more careful with his tricks, but his love for butter and fun remained as strong as ever.
